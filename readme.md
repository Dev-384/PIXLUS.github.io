## Install Node

NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for the terminal. PIXLUS uses this to host a client-side server to allow for the use of JavaScript modules in the web. Without NodeJS, PIXLUS would cease to function.

Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and download the installer for your operating system

Run the downloaded program to install NodeJS

## Startup

In the terminal, run:

> npm install
> 
> npm run server

This will install dependencies, and open the server.

## Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies, run:

> npm install

## Open Server

Run

> npm run server

OR

> node server.cjs

Using the NPM command will make sure to clear the terminal screen. Other than that, these are the same commands.
